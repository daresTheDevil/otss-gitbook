# What are flight rules?

Originally a guide for NASA astronauts on what to do when things go sideways...

> _**Flight Rules**_ are the hard-earned body of knowledge recorded in manuals that list, step-by-step, what to do if X occurs, and why. Essentially, they are extremely detailed, scenario-specific standard operating procedures. \[...\]

> NASA has been capturing our missteps, disasters and solutions since the early 1960s, when Mercury-era ground teams first started gathering "lessons learned" into a compendium that now lists thousands of problematic situations, from engine failure to busted hatch handles to computer glitches, and their solutions.

## OTSS Flight Rules

This isn't necessarily for when things go sideways, but also general documentation on how to do stuff in a way that doesn't make your team mad. If you're uncomfortable about doing something, there are probably pretty detailed instructions in this document. If you're STILL uncomfortable about something, please ask someone.

## Conventions

For clarity's sake, every flight rule we have should be simple enough that my mom could implement them. Take a user step-by-step, don't make assumptions, and test. Then test again.

```bash
# if you see a grey box like this, you'll probably have to type
# something in to a command prompt

cp -rf oldFolder newFolder
```

### Checklists are your friend

Nobody hates checklists. They also help assure anyone following your instructions that they did every step.

* [ ] Open your laptop
* [ ] Log in with your domain account
* [ ] Open your command prompt
* [ ] type `echo stuff`

### Really important information

{% hint style="info" %}
### Use hints

Hints are great ways to highlight important information.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Especially if they're red
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can even put things like lists in them

1. Follow
2. This
3. In order
{% endhint %}
